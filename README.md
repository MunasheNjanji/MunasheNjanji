    > I consider myself a fullstack developer. Oh well maybe I'm one:

      I am learning the following:
        - Django
        - React
        - Bootstrap 
        - jQuery
        - Vue.js
        - Docker
        - GrapgQL
        - RestAPIs(drf)
        - Wagtail
        - Kind ( A tool for running local Kubernetes clusters using Docker container “nodes”.)
        - Oh let's put Kubernetes
        - Nginx
        - I depend mostly on Django ORM nowadays but my preferred database is PostgreSQL()
      I have developed a lot of projects while learning along the tutorials and guides I follow
